# Calculate-Shape
This program defines the Shape, Rectangle, Circle, Triangle, and Square classes and implements a user-interactive main program that allows the user to choose a shape type and input its parameters. The program then calculates and displays the area and perimeter of the selected shape. It continues until the user chooses to exit the program.
